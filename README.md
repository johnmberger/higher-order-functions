#Higher Order Function Challenge

Below you'll find multiple functions that are invoked in odd and mysterious ways.

I've written the function definitions at the bottom of the file. At the top, I've writen statements that prove my functions work.


| Invocation    | Expected Output | Hint  |
| ------------- | -------------   | ----- |
| any([ 8, 9, 10, 11 ], greaterThan10) | true | greaterThan10 is a callback |
| surprise()() | 'surprise!' | Return a function |
| filter([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], onlyOdd) | [ 1, 3 ] |    onlyOdd is a callback |
| sumTwoNumbers(3)(9) | 12 | Return a function |
